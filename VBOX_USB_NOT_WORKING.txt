I've got solution finally... T-T

(It seems like problem of window 7)


1. My Host is window 7 32bit home premium. But, 64bit's solution may be same because problem was caused by USB filtering function of WINDOW 7.

2. first of all, edit your registry

- Open the Windows registry, by clicking on Start > Run and typing regedit
- Navigate to the following location HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{36FC9E60-C465-11CF-8056-444553540000}
- In the right hand panel, if the the UpperFilters entry exists, then delete it

3. Install virtualbox USB driver manually.

- Goto folder C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\drivers\USB\filter
- Click right mouse button on file named VboxUSBMon.inf
- Check Install(I) (maybe.. My window is korean so it dose not exact. )

4. Rebooting

5. Unplug your USB memory (or joystick..)

6. Open VirtualBox and Close it rightly.
( it will remove your USB device from VM's seized list. )

7. Plug your USB memory.

8. Open VirtualBox and Run Virtual Machine.

9. Click right mouse button on USB icon placed in status bar which is below VM window.

10. Check USB device what you want to plug in.

11. Enjoy !!
